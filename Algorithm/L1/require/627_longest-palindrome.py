# 627. Longest Palindrome
# ä¸­æ–‡English
# Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that
# can be built with those letters.
#
# This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
#
# Example
# Example 1:
#
# Input : s = "abccccdd"
# Output : 7
# Explanation :
# One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is `7`.
# Notice
# Assume the length of given string will not exceed 100000.

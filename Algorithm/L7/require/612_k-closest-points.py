# 612. K Closest Points
# ä¸­æ–‡English
# Given some points and an origin point in two-dimensional space, find k points which are nearest to the origin.
# Return these points sorted by distance, if they are same in distance, sorted by the x-axis, and if
# they are same in the x-axis, sorted by y-axis.
#
# Example
# Example 1:
#
# Input: points = [[4,6],[4,7],[4,4],[2,5],[1,1]], origin = [0, 0], k = 3
# Output: [[1,1],[2,5],[4,4]]
# Example 2:
#
# Input: points = [[0,0],[0,9]], origin = [3, 1], k = 1
# Output: [[0,0]]

# 843. Digital Flip
# Given an array of 01. You can flip 1 to be 0 or flip 0 to be 1.
#
# Find the minimum number of flipping steps so that the array meets the following rules:
#
# The back of 1 can be either1 or 0, but0 must be followed by 0.
#
# Example
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [1,0,0,1,1,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Turn two 0s into 1s.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Turn the second 1 and the third 1 into 0.
# Notice
# The length of the given array n <= 100000.
